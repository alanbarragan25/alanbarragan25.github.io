### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was one of my favorite labs; we made a program that took your order on making a sandwich in this lab. I found it interesting how this program makes it look like you're just talking to the computer as it asks what you liked on your sandwich. Around this point, I noticed the stuff we are working towards in this major.

* Lab 4


   Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite on my list as well because of how challenging it was numerically. In this lab we worked on a file called units.cc in which we also included another file called units_functions.h, we had to create a measurement system that converted to various other measurements. This lab helped me realize the knowledge we will need for this major.

* Lab 9


   Lab 9, part 1 has to be one of the top 3 favorite labs. In this lab, we created a program that tells you the average score in a list. For example, we made the computer be a judge for the Olympics as we provide the computer with a list of scores it figures out using Algebra what the average score is. This lab helped me process the math power a piece of code can hold.
